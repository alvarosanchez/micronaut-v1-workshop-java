Introductory workshop about http://micronaut.io[Micronaut].

== Software Requirements

In order to do this workshop, you need the following:

* Linux or MacOS with shell access, and the following installed:
    - `curl`.
    - `wget`.
    - `unzip`.
    - `git`.
* JDK 8.
* Docker. Please pull the following images before attending the workshop:
    - `consul`.
    - `mongo`.

=== Micronaut CLI

1. Install http://sdkman.io[SDKMAN!] if you haven't done so already.
2. Install Micronaut CLI:

    $ sdk install micronaut

3. Ensure the CLI is installed properly:

    $ mn --version
    | Micronaut Version: 1.1.0
    | JVM Version: 1.8.0_191

=== Clone this repository

Once done, you can clone this repo:

----
git clone https://github.com/alvarosanchez/micronaut-workshop-java.git
----

NOTE: You will find each exercise's template files on each `exNN` folder. Solution is always inside a `solution` folder. To highlight the actions you actually need to perform, an icon is used: icon:hand-o-right[]

== Application architecture 

Throughout this workshop, we will be creating a football (soccer) management system.

ifdef::generate-diagrams[]
[plantuml, football-diagram, png]
....
together {
    node Fixtures
    database Mongo
}

together {
    node Clubs
    database H2
}

Clubs -> H2
H2 -[hidden]- Fixtures
Fixtures -> Mongo
Fixtures -> Clubs
....
endif::[]

image::football-diagram.png[]

* `clubs` is the microservice responsible for managing clubs. It uses Hibernate 
  as a data access layer.
* `fixtures` manages all game fixtures, storing its data in MongoDB. For the 
  teams playing in a game, it doesn't store their full details, but rather their 
  ID. It has a service-discovery-enabled HTTP client to fetch club details from 
  the `clubs` microservice.

== Getting started with Micronaut and its CLI (25 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `ex01` directory to work on this exercise

The Micronaut CLI is the recommended way to create new Micronaut projects. The 
CLI includes commands for generating specific categories of projects, allowing 
you to choose between build tools, test frameworks, and even pick the language 
you wish to use in your application. The CLI also provides commands for generating 
artifacts such as controllers, client interfaces, and serverless functions.

The `create-app` command is the starting point for creating Micronaut applications.
The CLI is based on the concept of **profiles**. A profile consist of a project
template (or skeleton), optional features, and profile-specific commands. Commands 
from a profile typically are specific to the profile application type; for example, 
the `service` profile (designed for creation of microservice applications) provides 
the `create-controller` and `create-client` commands.

=== Listing profiles (3 minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] You can list the available profiles with the `list-profiles` command:

----
$ mn list-profiles
| Available Profiles
--------------------
  cli                 The cli profile
  configuration       The profile for creating the configuration
  federation          The federation profile
  function-aws        The function profile for AWS Lambda
  function-aws-alexa  The function profile for AWS Lambda
  grpc                Profile for Creating GRPC Services
  kafka               The Kafka messaging profile
  profile             A profile for creating new Micronaut profiles
  rabbitmq            The RabbitMQ messaging profile
  service             The service profile
----


Applications generated from a profile can be personalised with **features**. A 
feature further customises the newly created project by adding additional 
dependencies to the build, more files to the project skeleton, etc.

=== Getting information about a profile (2 minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] To see all the features of a profile, you can
use the `profile-info` command:

=== Creating and running a _hello galaxy_ (15 minutes)

As explained avobe, the `create-app` command can be used to create new projects.
It accepts some flags:

.Create-App Flags
|===
|Flag|Description|Example

|`build`
|Build tool (one of `gradle`, `maven` - default is `gradle`)
|`--build maven`

|`profile`
|Profile to use for the project (default is `service`)
|`--profile function-aws`

|`features`
|Features to use for the project, comma-separated
|`--features security-jwt,mongo-gorm`

|`inplace`
|If present, generates the project in the current directory (project name is optional if this flag is set)
|`--inplace`
|===

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's create a _hello galaxy_ project:

----
$ mn create-app hello-galaxy
| Generating Java project...
| Application created at /Users/alvarosanchez/hello-galaxy
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, move into the generated `hello-galaxy` folder and let's 
create a controller:

----
$ mn create-controller hello
| Rendered template Controller.java to destination src/main/java/hello/galaxy/HelloController.java
| Rendered template ControllerTest.java to destination src/test/java/hello/galaxy/HelloControllerTest.java
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Open the generated `HelloController.java` with your favourite 
IDE and make it return "Hello Galaxy!":

[source,java]
----
include::./ex01/solution/hello-galaxy/src/main/java/hello/galaxy/HelloController.java[tag=action,indent=0]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, run the application:

    $ ./gradlew run

You will see a line similar to the following once the application has started

    14:40:01.187 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 957ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, on another shell, make a request to your service:

----
$ curl 0:8080/hello
Hello Galaxy!
----

=== Write an automated test (5 minutes)

While testing manually is acceptable in some situations, going forward it is 
better to have automated tests to exercise our applications. Fortunately,
Micronaut makes testing super easy!

Micronaut applications can be tested with any testing framework, because
`io.micronaut.context.ApplicationContext` is capable of spinning up embedded
instances quite easily. The CLI adds support for using JUnit, Spock and Spek.

In addition to that, if you are using JUnit 5 or Spock, there is special support that allows
to remove most of the boilerplate about starting/stopping server and injecting beans. Check
the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html[Micronaut Test]
project for more information.

We will use Gradle to run the tests, however, if you want to run them from your IDE, make
sure you enable annotation processors. For example, in Intellij IDEA:

image::http://guides.micronaut.io/micronaut-data-access-jpa-hibernate/img/annotationprocessorsintellij.png[]

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, change the generated `src/test/java/hello/galaxy/HelloControllerTest.java`
to look like this:

+++ <details><summary> +++
Click to expand
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source,java]
----
include::./ex01/solution/hello-galaxy/src/test/java/hello/galaxy/HelloControllerTest.java[]
----
+++ </div></details> +++

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, run the tests:

    ./gradlew test

Once finished, you should see an output similar to:

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 5s

== Creating the Clubs microservice (70 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `ex02` directory to work on this exercise.

icon:hand-o-right[] In this exercise we are creating the `clubs` microservice. Start with:

----
mn create-app --features hibernate-jpa clubs
----

And open it in your IDE.

The `hibernate-jpa` feature will bring to the newly created project:

* The required build dependencies to have Hibernate, a Tomcat-based JDBC connection pool 
  and an H2 in-memory database (`build.gradle`).
* The data source configuration to use such H2 database (`src/main/resources/application.yml`).

icon:hand-o-right[] Check yourself the above files to see how it is configured.

=== JPA layer (15 minutes)

Our model will reside in the `clubs.domain` package. We need to configure JPA to search for
entities in this package.

icon:hand-o-right[] Change `jpa` section of `src/main/resources/application.yml` so that it looks like:

[source,yaml]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/resources/application.yml[tags=jpa]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's define first a `Club` entity under
`src/main/java/clubs/domain/Club.java` with 2 string attributes:
`name` (mandatory) and `stadium` (optional).

You need to use JPA annotations on the entity such as `@Entity` and `@Id`. If you are not familiar with JPA,
check the solution file.

icon:hand-o-right[] Next, define repository named `ClubRepository` as an interface with 
the following operations:

[source,java]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/java/clubs/domain/ClubRepository.java[tag=operations,indent=0]
----

Now, let's write the implementation using JPA:

+++ <details><summary> +++
Click to expand
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source,java]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/java/clubs/domain/ClubRepositoryImpl.java[tag=class]
----
+++ </div></details> +++

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, let's write a test for our implementation:

+++ <details><summary> +++
Click to expand
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source,java]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/test/java/clubs/ClubRepositoryImplTest.java[tag=test]
----
+++ </div></details> +++

WARNING: For package-scanning reasons, you need to ensure your test classes are located at
the top of the package hierarchy, so that Micronaut can find annotations in packages underneath.
In this exercise, place your tests in the `clubs` package and make sure there are no classes
outside of it.

=== REST API (30 minutes)

Micronaut helps you writing both the client and server sides of a REST API. In this service,
we are going to create the following:

ifdef::generate-diagrams[]
[plantuml, clubs-diagram, png]
....
ClubsApi <<interface>>
ClubsClient <<interface>>

ClubsApi <|-- ClubsClient
ClubsApi <|-- ClubController

ClubsApi : @Get("/") List<Club> listClubs()
ClubsApi : @Get("/{id}") Club show(@NotNull Long id)
ClubsApi : @Post("/") Club save(@NotNull String name, String stadium)
....
endif::[]

image::clubs-diagram.png[]

icon:hand-o-right[] Create the `ClubsApi` interface, annotating its methods with 
`io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` or `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Post` as described in the diagram.

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, create `ClubsClient` by simply extending from `ClubsApi`.
Annotate the interface with `io.micronaut.http.client.Client("/")`.

icon:hand-o-right[] Finally, implement the controller `ClubController`. Annotate
the class with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller("/")`, matching the path
specified on `ClubsClient`. Use `ClubRepository` to implement the actions by declaring 
a constructor dependency on it.

WARNING: The controller actions need to be annotated with `@Get` / `@Post` again.

icon:hand-o-right[] Finally, configure `logback.xml` to see some relevant output

[source,xml]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/resources/logback.xml[tag=!default]
----
<1> Debug level for our code
<2> This allows to see the HTTP request and responses from the HTTP clients.

icon:hand-o-right[] Once you have it, write an end-to-end test:

+++ <details><summary> +++
Click to expand
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source,java]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/test/java/clubs/ClubControllerTest.java[tag=test]
----
+++ </div></details> +++

=== Load some data for production (15 minutes)

During our tests, we have been seeding test data on demand, as it is a good
practise to isolate test data from test to test. However, for production, we 
want some data loaded

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's create a bean to load some data. Run:

    mn create-bean dataLoader

icon:hand-o-right[] Change it to look like:

+++ <details><summary> +++
Click to expand
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source,java]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/java/clubs/init/DataLoader.java[tag=class]
----
+++ </div></details> +++

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, run the application:

    ./gradlew run

icon:hand-o-right[] And make a request to `0:8080/` to see the results:

=== Register the service in Consul (10 minutes)

We want the `clubs` microservice to be discoverable by the `fixtures` service.
So we will enable Micronaut's Consul support for service discovery.

icon:hand-o-right[] First, add the neccessary dependency in `build.gradle`:

[source,java]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/build.gradle[tag=dep,indent=0]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, change `src/main/resources/application.yml` to define
the Consul configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=consul]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Finally, run a Consul instance with Docker:

    $ docker run -d --name=dev-consul -e CONSUL_BIND_INTERFACE=eth0 -e CONSUL_UI_BETA=true -p 8500:8500 consul

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, if you run the application, you will see it registers
with Consul at startup:

----
$ ./gradlew run
...
04:20:09.501 [nioEventLoopGroup-1-3] INFO  i.m.d.registration.AutoRegistration - Registered service [clubs] with Consul
...
----

icon:hand-o-right[] If you go the http://localhost:8500/[Consul UI], you can see
it shows as registered:

image::consul.png[]

icon:hand-o-right[] You can run yet another instance of `clubs` on a different
shell, and see it registered. In order to do that, you need to tell Micronaut to
run on a random port. In `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=random-port]
----

We will use them both with Micronaut's load-balanced
HTTP client in the next exercise.

== Creating the Fixtures microservice (70 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `ex03` directory to work on this exercise.

icon:hand-o-right[] In this exercise we are creating the `fixtures` microservice:

    mn create-app --features=mongo-reactive,discovery-consul fixtures

Once again, follow the steps of exercise 1 to add Micronaut Test to this project. Also,
remove the `de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo` dependency, as we are using a Dockerized MongoDB 
instance.

=== Data layer (35 minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] First of all, run MongoDB with Docker:

    $ docker run -d --name=dev-mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, create the `Fixture` domain class with the following properties:

[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/java/fixtures/domain/Fixture.java[tag=fields,indent=0]
----

As you can see, we are only storing club's ids. When rendering fixture details,
we will use Micronaut's HTTP client to fetch details from the `clubs` microservice.

icon:hand-o-right[] We also need a constructor with annotations that allow `Fixture` instances to be marshalled and unmarshalled 
to/from JSON and as a MongoDB document:

[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/java/fixtures/domain/Fixture.java[tag=constructor,indent=0]
----

Be sure to add all the getter and setters as well.

icon:hand-o-right[] The next thing we need is an HTTP client for the `clubs` microservice. Create one with:

    $ mn create-client clubs

Before actually mapping any endpoint, we are going to create the following hierarchy:

ifdef::generate-diagrams[]
[plantuml, clients-diagram, png]
....
ClubsApi <<interface>>
ClubsClient <<interface>>

ClubsApi <|-- ClubsClient
ClubsApi <|-- ClubsClientMock

ClubsApi : @Get("/{id}") Club show(Long id)
....
endif::[]

image::clients-diagram.png[]

* `ClubsApi` is the interface that contains the client endpoint mappings.
* `ClubsClient` is the production client, is annotated with `@Client` and simply
  extends from `ClubsApi`.
* `ClubsClientMock` is a mocking client (resides within `src/test/java`), is annotated 
  with `@Fallback`, and implements `ClubsApi` by returning hardcoded instances.

This is how `ClubsApi` looks like:

[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/java/fixtures/clubs/ClubsApi.java[tag=class]
----

We are using a reactive type in the HTTP client response, so that is a hint
for Micronaut to make it non-blocking.

Then, the production client:

[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/java/fixtures/clubs/ClubsClient.java[tag=class]
----
<1> `"clubs"` is the Consul name for the Clubs microservice (which registers 
    itself with the `micronaut.application.name` property).

Finally, the mocking client:

[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/test/java/fixtures/ClubsClientMock.java[tag=class]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] We also need a `Club` POJO to capture the JSON response from `clubs`. Define
it with 2 string fields: `name` and `stadium`, and its constructor, getters, etc.

icon:hand-o-right[] Now let's create a repository for `Fixture`. Following the same convention as
in the previous exercise, begin with an interface:

[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/java/fixtures/domain/FixtureRepository.java[tag=class,indent=0]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, the implementation:

+++ <details><summary> +++
Click to expand
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/java/fixtures/domain/FixtureRepositoryImpl.java[tag=class,indent=0]
----
+++ </div></details> +++

icon:hand-o-right[] And a test:

+++ <details><summary> +++
Click to expand
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/test/java/fixtures/FixtureRepositoryImplTest.java[tag=class,indent=0]
----
+++ </div></details> +++

Make sure it passes.

=== REST API (35 minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's create a controller for displaying fixtures:

    $ mn create-controller fixture

As it was said earlier, our `Fixture` class doesn't store club names, but their id's (with the intention of
having this microservice call the other). Therefore, we need a DTO class to represent what our JSON response
is going to look like.

icon:hand-o-right[] Create a POJO named `FixtureResponse` with the following attributes:

[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/java/fixtures/controller/FixtureResponse.java[tag=fields,indent=0]
----

Now we need a service that transforms a `Fixture` into a `FixtureResponse`. To do so, it need to make
2 HTTP calls to the `clubs` microservice, to get the name of each clubs. It will use `ClubsClient` for that.

icon:hand-o-right[] Create a `FixtureService` like this:

+++ <details><summary> +++
Click to expand
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/java/fixtures/service/FixtureService.java[tag=class]
----
+++ </div></details> +++

icon:hand-o-right[] And write a test for it:

+++ <details><summary> +++
Click to expand
+++ </summary><div> +++
[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/test/java/fixtures/FixtureServiceTest.java[tag=class]
----
+++ </div></details> +++

Finally, we need the REST controller that connect the dots.

icon:hand-o-right[] Create a `FixtureController` that uses `FixtureRepository` and `FixtureService` as
collaborators to produce a `Flowable<FixtureResponse>` response:

[source,java]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/java/fixtures/controller/FixtureController.java[tag=action,indent=0]
----

=== Load some data and run the application (10 minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] Similarly to the previous exercise, seed the application with some data.

Also, we need to set the `micronaut.server.port` configuration property a value other than 8080,
otherwise, we won't be able to run both services.

icon:hand-o-right[] In `application.yml`, set `micronaut.server.port` to `8081`


icon:hand-o-right[] Now, run the application:

    ./gradlew run

If you make a request to the default controller, and the `clubs` microservice is not running,
you will see an error:

----
{"message":"Internal Server Error: No available services for ID: clubs"}
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, run the `clubs` service on a different terminal, and try the request again.
